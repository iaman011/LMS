here we require two things models and schema
 you can define a schema to enforce a structure on the documents within a collection.

ðŸ“– In Simple Terms:
A schema is a blueprint or structure that defines:

What fields a document should have.

What data types those fields should be.

Which fields are required, have default values, or are unique.

we can also have to perform the validation like zod validation means name have 6 char password more than 8 char etc
