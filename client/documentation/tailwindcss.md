w-full
w-1/2
w-50
w-fit


<!-- className="w-fit absolute right-2 z-50" -->
 Class	Meaning
w-fit	Width = fit-content. The element takes only as much horizontal space as its content needs (no extra width).
absolute	Positions the element absolutely relative to the nearest relative parent (e.g., relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky).
right-2	Moves the element 8px from the right edge (since Tailwind spacing unit 2 = 0.5rem = 8px).
z-50	Sets z-index to 50, meaning it will appear above most other elements (higher stacking order).

ðŸ§  In Short:
This class combo positions a small element (like a button or icon) at the top-right corner of a container, ensuring:

It only takes as much width as needed (w-fit),

It floats on top of other elements (z-50),

Itâ€™s placed 8px from the right edge of its parent.
